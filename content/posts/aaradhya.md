# Welcome to Aaradhya Tripathee's Blog
Hello! I'm Aaradhya Tripathi, and I'm 8 years old. I go to Sifal Secondary School, and my favorite subjects are English, Nepali, Science, Hamro Serofero, Maths, and more. My dad's name is Amrish Tripathi, and my mom's name is Radha Panthi Tripathi. I really enjoy going to school!
